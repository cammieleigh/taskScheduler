# Overview

The code that I wrote was a to do list scheduler. You can input, edit, and delete tasks that have associated with a day.

I wrote this software to become more familiar with Java, as I have not used Java before. I used it to get experience with the basics of Java.

# Development Environment

For this software I used visual studio code, and my program runs through command line.

I used Java for this, and I important the util libraries, the main one I used however was Scanner.

- I would like to make it more user friendly with a UI
